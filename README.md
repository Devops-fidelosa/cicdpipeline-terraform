# CI/CD pipeline using Terraform, Packer, Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, Datree, and ArgoCD

# Step-1 : Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
Before we embark on the journey of creating a CI/CD pipeline, it’s essential to establish a solid infrastructure foundation. Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, empowers us to define and provision infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner.

To create the EKS cluster, we will define its infrastructure as code using Terraform. This includes specifying the desired AWS region, node groups, and other critical settings. 

# Step-2 :Custom Jenkins and SonarQube Images with Packer
To ensure control and consistency in your CI/CD pipeline, custom images for Jenkins and SonarQube are vital. Packer enables us to create tailored images that include specific plugins and configurations.

Create Packer Templates for Jenkins and SonarQube Images:

Craft Packer templates that define the desired configurations for Jenkins and SonarQube.
Build Custom Images with Packer:

Execute Packer to build custom images for Jenkins and SonarQube.
Incorporate necessary Jenkins plugins and the SonarQube scanner for SonarQube integration.

# Step-3 :Setting Up GitHub Repository
Central to the CI/CD pipeline is the source code residing in a GitHub repository. Ensure your code is organized and follows best practices for efficient CI/CD integration.

Create a GitHub Repository for Your Project:

Establish a dedicated repository for your application code.
Commit and push your code to this repository for version control.

# Step-4 :Jenkins CI Setup
With the infrastructure and custom images in place, it’s time to set up Jenkins for continuous integration:

Install Jenkins on a Server Using Custom Jenkins Image:

*Deploy Jenkins on a server using the custom Jenkins image created earlier.

Add Necessary Jenkins Plugins:

Enhance Jenkins functionality by installing essential plugins, including SonarQube and SonarQube Quality Gate, Docker and Docker Pipeline.
Also make sure to install AWS CLI, Docker and Helm CLI on Jenkins Server under jenkins user with switching sudo su -jenkins.
Create a Role for Jenkins:

Define a role for Jenkins with appropriate permissions.
Grant this role full access to the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and SSM Manager.
Attach the Jenkins Role to the Jenkins Server:

Associate the Jenkins role with the Jenkins server to enable interaction with ECR.

# Step-5 :SonarQube Integration with Jenkins:
Ensure that your SonarQube server is up and running, and it is accessible on port 9000. You can access it via a web browser by navigating to http://your-sonarqube-server:9000.

Initial Configuration:

Upon logging in for the first time, SonarQube may prompt you to change the admin password for security reasons. Follow the on-screen instructions to update the password.

Generate an Authentication Token:

To enable Jenkins to interact with SonarQube, it’s a good practice to generate an authentication token. This token will be used by Jenkins to authenticate with SonarQube.
Navigate to your SonarQube server by clicking on your username (admin) in the top right corner and selecting “My Account.”
In the “Security” section, click on “Security” again to access the security settings.
Click on “Generate Token” to create an authentication token. Provide a name for the token (e.g., “Jenkins Integration”) and click “Generate.”

Configure Jenkins Integration with SonarQube:

*In your Jenkins pipeline or job configuration, you’ll need to configure the integration with SonarQube. This typically involves using the SonarQube Scanner for Jenkins.
*Install the SonarQube Scanner plugin in Jenkins if not already installed.
*In your Jenkins job configuration, you should find a section related to SonarQube analysis. Configure it with the following details:
*SonarQube server URL: http://your-sonarqube-server:9000
*SonarQube authentication token: Use the token generated in previous step.
*Other relevant settings, such as project key, sources directory, etc.
