# CI/CD pipeline using Terraform, Packer, Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, Datree, and ArgoCD

# Step-1 : Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
Before we embark on the journey of creating a CI/CD pipeline, it’s essential to establish a solid infrastructure foundation. Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, empowers us to define and provision infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner.

To create the EKS cluster, we will define its infrastructure as code using Terraform. This includes specifying the desired AWS region, node groups, and other critical settings. 

# Step-2 :Custom Jenkins and SonarQube Images with Packer
To ensure control and consistency in your CI/CD pipeline, custom images for Jenkins and SonarQube are vital. Packer enables us to create tailored images that include specific plugins and configurations.

Create Packer Templates for Jenkins and SonarQube Images:

Craft Packer templates that define the desired configurations for Jenkins and SonarQube.
Build Custom Images with Packer:

Execute Packer to build custom images for Jenkins and SonarQube.
Incorporate necessary Jenkins plugins and the SonarQube scanner for SonarQube integration.

# Step-3 :Setting Up GitHub Repository
Central to the CI/CD pipeline is the source code residing in a GitHub repository. Ensure your code is organized and follows best practices for efficient CI/CD integration.

Create a GitHub Repository for Your Project:

Establish a dedicated repository for your application code.
Commit and push your code to this repository for version control.

# Step-4 :Jenkins CI Setup
With the infrastructure and custom images in place, it’s time to set up Jenkins for continuous integration:

Install Jenkins on a Server Using Custom Jenkins Image:

*Deploy Jenkins on a server using the custom Jenkins image created earlier.

Add Necessary Jenkins Plugins:

Enhance Jenkins functionality by installing essential plugins, including SonarQube and SonarQube Quality Gate, Docker and Docker Pipeline.
Also make sure to install AWS CLI, Docker and Helm CLI on Jenkins Server under jenkins user with switching sudo su -jenkins.
Create a Role for Jenkins:

Define a role for Jenkins with appropriate permissions.
Grant this role full access to the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and SSM Manager.
Attach the Jenkins Role to the Jenkins Server:

Associate the Jenkins role with the Jenkins server to enable interaction with ECR.
